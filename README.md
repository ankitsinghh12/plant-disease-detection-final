# plant-disease-detection-final

It is a machine learning project that uses transfer learning to detect plant diseases. The project uses the VGG16 model, which is a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large dataset of images. The project then fine-tunes the VGG16 model on a dataset of plant images that have been labeled with the name of the disease.

The project is divided into two parts:

1. Data preparation: The first part of the project involves preparing the data. This includes downloading the plant images, labeling the images, and splitting the data into a training set and a test set.
2. Model training: The second part of the project involves training the model. This is done by using the training set to train the VGG16 model. The model is then evaluated on the test set to see how well it performs.
   
The project is still under development, but the author has achieved a validation accuracy of 92%. This means that the model is able to correctly identify 92% of the plant diseases in the test set.

The project is a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in developing a plant disease detection system. The project provides a good starting point for developing a machine-learning model for plant disease detection.

Here are some of the key features of the plant disease detection project:

1. It uses transfer learning, which is a technique that can be used to improve the performance of a machine-learning model.
2. It has been trained on a large dataset of plant images, which allows the model to generalize well to new images.
3. It has achieved a validation accuracy of 92%, which is a good indication of the model's performance.
