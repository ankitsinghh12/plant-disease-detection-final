# Plant Disease Detection Benchmark models


**Objective:**
- Using different neural network Archetectures implement Neural Net Prediction Model ,Sothat we may have a baseline model accuracy to compare the future progress

**Resources:**
- [Using Deep Learning for Image-Based Plant Disease Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.03169.pdf)
- [Data set](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset)
- [Models](https://gitlab.com/Israel777/Plant_Disease_Detection_models)

[Models](https://gitlab.com/Israel777/Plant_Disease_Detection_models)

Approches for Solving the papers realtime Detection Problem

	phase 1 : implement the paper 
	phase 2 : do analysis on the paper and identify the type of data problem 
	phase 3 : experement and if possible generate Apprprate data
		  using the data train the model again
